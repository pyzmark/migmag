# MigMag Data Analytic Visualization
Contained here are a collection of visualization frameworks built for MigMag (Migration and the Making of the Ancient Greek World) project at the University of Vienna. They are currently not available for public use, though the code is available.
## Odyssey
The Odyssey visualizer maps and tracks the journeys of a number of mythical and historical founders of Greek colonies. The evidence is primarily literary, and so texts are presented alongside a map. This is built within a Streamlit (https://streamlit.io/) environment in Python, with maps being provided through the Folium library. The code for this is mainly in odyssey_dash.py, with an API access method and data builder contained in odyssey_updater.py.

The app was written by Mark Pyzyk. Comments and questions can be sent to: pyzmark@gmail.com
