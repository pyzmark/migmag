The principal archaeological remains in the area, however, are to be seen at the very extremity of the island, 9km to the south across a deserted area now occupied mostly by the Military. The track to the right (west) just in front of the isthmus of the islet of Prasonísi, leads to the foot of a sloping promontory, on which are the remains of Ancient Vrouliá, a Late Geometric/Early Archaic settlement (8th to 6th centuries BC). Most of what is of interest to the visitor lies on the far side of the hill. A wall runs northwest/southeast along the ridge and the stepped or terraced foundations of the ancient houses run along this axis. At the summit, with good views of Karpathos and beyond, the remains of the most substantial building lie athwart the main axis and are oriented east/west, suggesting a probable cultic use. Beyond, at the northwestern extremity, is a sheer drop to the sea below. The site has given its name to a distinctive style of Archaic, blackfigure pottery, in which floral designs are lightly incised into the dark surface and colours added afterwards.(McGilchrist's Greek Islands)",,,,

Pharmakonísi takes its name from medicinal herbs which grow in abundance on the island: today—mostly borage, different kinds of sage, and the common culinary herbs. Pharmakousa's greatest claim to fame is that the young Julius Caesar was kidnapped by Cilician pirates here in 74 BC. The pirates were ignorant of whom they had seized, and when they demanded a ransom of 20 talents, he laughed at their request and offered them 50. It took 38 days to arrange the ransom, during which time the aspiring politician practised writing speeches and poems, which he tried out on his captors. Freed on receipt of the ransom, he returned to Miletus, commandeered a boat, pursued his former captors until he overtook them, and had them crucified, as he had laughingly promised them. The early 16th century Ottoman admiral, Piri Reis visited the island, and noted in particular a ‘grove of mastic trees'. N.B. Because of its sensitive frontier location, the whole island of Pharmakonísi is currently occupied by the Greek Military and is off-limits to civilian visits, except by prior permission of the Ministry of Defence. Pharmakonisi has a number of remains from Antiquity: vaulted 'tholoi', like those in Agathonisi, and the lower courses, with drafted corners, of two Hellenistic towers in late 4th century BC construction-technique stand near the hill-top church of Aghios Giorgios. There are the remains of a Byzantine church, some contemporaneous secular buildings, and traces of mosaic floor in the stretch between Thóli Bay and Paliómantra.

Gialí is the largest of the satellite islands of Nisyros, and one of the most productive quarries of pumice in the world.

Gialí also has perlite deposits in the north of the island and obsidian in the northwest corner. The presence of these materials has meant that the island has been inhabited since earliest times: a significant Late Neolithic settlement, with dwellings (including a building of elliptical plan) and workshops, has been uncovered near the summit of the southwest part of the island: crucibles for smelting copper have also been found. There is less visible evidence of a Bronze Age presence even though it is clear there was a Minoan interest in the island's obsidian.

Recent finds, which include a Minoan artefact and a Cycladic figurine, point to the island's position as a maritime ‘stepping-stone' in the empty waters between the Cyclades, Crete and Rhodes in prehistoric times. At least four ancient shipwrecks have also been identified in the area.

He brought with him many settlers from Crete; the name of the village above the coast below— Kritinía, or Cretenia in Antiquity—may derive from this. At Acragas (Agrigento) in Sicily, Zeus Atabyrios was worshipped together with Athena, whose cult may also have been present on the mountaintop here. A number of figurines of bulls have been found at this site, and ancient sources refer to the presence of large bronze bulls in the sanctuary which were wont to bellow and groan when some ill-fate was approaching.

After Santorini, Nisyros is the most significant volcano in the Aegean. From hewn blocks of a dense basaltic rock created by this volcano, the ancient inhabitants of Nisyros constructed daunting walls to protect the acropolis of their city. They are extensive and very well preserved, and they constitute one of the most impressive (and least known) ancient remains in Greece.
Strabo, in his account of the island (Geog. X 5.16) points out that ‘Nisyros is said to be a fragment of Cos.' Study of the geology of the area bears this out: until a catastrophic eruption around 160,000 years ago Nisyros may well have been a part of Kos. The legend, he continues, is that Poseidon in his pursuit of Polyvotis, broke off a fragment of the island, and buried the fuming giant beneath it—explaining in this way the island's habitual volcanic activity.

To the east, in the open area in front of the building, are the remains of the 3rd century BC Temple of Aphrodite, uncovered by Italian archaeologists in 1922. The temple—as was customary with shrines to Aphrodite who was a patron divinity of sailors—occupied a prime location between the commercial and military ports. It was perhaps the lack of space in this crowded area of Ancient Rhodes which gave rise to the unusual form of the temple. The temple design was amphipro-style in antis, with a colonnade of half-engaged columns on the interiors of the longer sides. It was designed so as not to make maximum use of the limited space available. The poor quality of the stone used meant that it would originally have been dressed with stucco. The fact that different elements from the temple and the surrounding area have been stored and erected on top of the foundations without respect to the building's original design, does not permit a clear reading of the site. The building was oriented east–west; the long sides had the engaged colonnade, and the two column stumps now placed along their length, may originally have served to support the east portico. The fragments of a heavily decorated entablature, on the ground along the north side, have been moved here from the Roman tetrapylon of Antoninus Pius (middle of the 2nd century AD) which we have seen north of the ‘House of Djem'. It is possibly from this temple that the statue of Aphrodite ‘Pudica' now in the Archaeology Museum, came.

Set in its own archipelago of islets off the west coast of Rhodes, Chalki is strikingly different in atmosphere from anything on Rhodes itself. The wealth once brought to this tiny, infertile island by the sponge-trade in the 19th century is immediately evident in the gracious sweep of stone houses of neoclassical inspiration that encircle the harbour. The island supported a relatively large population and several settlements in Antiquity, the remains of which have been found all the way from the east coast (the temple of Apollo at Pefkiá) to the island's western extremity at Cape Kepháli (where there are ruins of a Hellenistic tower), as well as in the area of the island's walled acropolis high above the centre of the south coast. Although the island's name appears to refer to ‘copper' (anc. Greek, chalkós), there is no remaining evidence either of the extraction or the working of the metal on the island. It is possible that the name instead derives from the Phoenician word ‘karki' or ‘kalchi' meaning ‘murex shells', from which purple dye was extracted: indeed the island's mediaeval name, still sometimes used by mariners today, was ‘Charki'.

The (main) left branch continues south. A track off to the left after 1800m, leads towards the summit of Mount Zíni: on its southern slopes is the cave of Asprípetra. (A path signed with red, then green, marks on rocks, leaves from the middle of the split in the road 600m down the track from the previous junction: 25 minutes walk.) The cave is small in proportion to its historic importance. First excavated by Italian archaeologists in 1922, it yielded finds and artefacts from the late Neolithic, Mycenaean and Geometric periods, as well as evidence that Pan and the Nymphs were venerated here in Hellenistic and Roman times. The finds point to the existence of a peak sanctuary in the area; the name of the mountain, ‘Zíni', could be cognate with ‘Zeus', suggesting the dedication and the site of such a sanctuary on the summit above.

One kilometre south of Képhalos on the road which heads towards the mountains, and c. 50m to the east of the road, can be seen the profile of the remarkable little church of the Panaghia Palatianí, on an eminence with views of the Bay of Képhalos below. This roofless and collapsing church occupies the site of—and is constructed out of the remains of—a Hellenistic Temple to Demeter, with the podium of the pagan building still clearly visible beneath the southeast corner. (Its stone is of the same warm-red colour observed above in the North Basilica at Aghios Stéphanos.) Many ancient stones and fragments lie within and around, and the terracing and decorative elements of its sanctuary or neighbouring buildings can be seen below.
The temple to Demeter did not stand alone here, but must have been on the edge of the ancient city of Astypalaia, whose overgrown remains, known locally as Palatía, lie in the pine-woods further to the west. (Continue along the road a further 600–700m: 20m before a junction with water-fountain, where the road splits for Aghios Theologos, an unsigned metal gate on the east side of the road leads into the trees.) Just below the road is a small, ancient theatre: the bases of the proscenium columns, and a couple of rows of marble seats are visible. Ten metres further to the west is a small Doric temple, di-style in antis, oriented due east, and constructed in the large, clear masonry typical of the late Classical period: the marble blocks are eroded and lichen-covered, yet still preserve their fine finishing. The city stretched up behind to the watershed above, which looks out also to the west: the platform of another temple (this time oriented north–south) and column fragments, can be seen here, just above the level of the modern road. Ancient Astypalaia must also have stretched on below the theatre—down the fertile and protected slope to the east, incorporating the harbour at Kamari as its port. The position has those panoramic qualities and natural beauty so favoured by the Ancients in their choice of sites.

In antiquity the islet was a link in the chain of military surveillance posts in the Rhodian State, and the impressive remains of a substantial Hellenistic fort and tower (dating from the 4th century BC) crown the ridge in the middle of the island. Constructed onto a natural outcrop of rock, the clean rows of isodomic masonry of the tower still stand in several layers to a height of about four metres. The walls have been reinforced on the interior with packed, rounded stones, perhaps when the tower was still being used during the Byzantine and Hospitaller periods. In the interior on the west side is a plastered cistern. Walls extend outside the tower enclosing an area of approximately 30m x 25m, suggesting that this was a small garrison post, and more than just a signalling tower.

 On the upper eastern slope of Mount Smith are the excavations of a so-called ‘Palatial Building' and of a Hellenistic house, which lie to either side of Enoplon Dynameon Street. In the latter, below the level of a peristyle and pebble-mosaic floor can be seen a plastered, multiple-chambered cistern, suggesting an impluvium for water storage. Mosaic floor and elements of the water management system of a large residence can be seen in the ‘Palatial Building' excavations.

Near the village of Çamlik in the district of Bucak in the province of Burdur. The village is situated on the Tauros 60 km SE of Burdur and 15 km from Bucak. According to Strabo (12.569), Kremna and the other cities of Pisidia were first captured by Amyntas, the commander of the Galatian auxiliary army of Brutus and Cassius, who became king of Galatia and Pisidia on going over to the side of Antonius. Octavian allowed him to remain king until his death in 25 B.C., after which Kremna (Mon.Anc. 28; Strab. 12.569） was made into a Roman colony (Colonia Iulia Augusta [Felix] Cremnena,CIL III, 6873). Coins of the Imperial period were first minted at Kremna during the reign of Hadrian. The donatio given by the emperor Aurelian (270-75) was followed by a period of brilliant prosperity in Kremna, but not long after, in A.D. 276, during the reign of the emperor Probus, the acropolis was occupied by the Isaurian bandit leader Lydios, who used it as a fortress against the Romans, and was thus able to hold out for a considerable time (Zosimos 1.67). Kremna was included in the Byzantine province of Pamphylia, and it is clear that settlement continued there uninterrupted, though on a smaller scale. In 787 Kremna sent a representative to the Second Council of Nicaea. Meanwhile the inhabitants had probably left the steep slopes and settled in what is now the village of Çamlik, which had been a village or suburb of the ancient city, bringing the name of their city with them. Thus Girme, the old name of the Turkish village, is derived from Kremna. According to the last information regarding the city (Not. Dig. 10) Kremna was the administrative center of the province.
In 1874 the site was definitely identified as Kremna by the discovery of a dedicatory inscription containing the name. Excavations were begun in 1970.
Kremna is situated on a hill dominating the valley of the Kastros (Aksu) and extending from E to W across a plateau 1000 m above sea level. The hill is 250 m above the level of the plateau, with sheer slopes on the N, E, and S, so that the city can be approached only from the W. Although on this side it is connected with the plateau by gentle slopes the hill is isolated by a deep ravine formed by flood waters. Thus the topographical situation of the acropolis makes it almost impregnable. The acropolis itself is not level for there are a number of small hills on the N, E, and SE. Most of the public buildings are concentrated within two small valleys, the forum and the basilica situated at the junction of the two valleys. To the N of the forum are cisterns, and to the S the library (?). The theater is situated on the slopes of the E hill, with the stoa and the gymnasium to the E of this. To the NE of the gymnasium lies the macellum, to the W of the forum a colonnaded street, and to the W of the basilica a monumental propylon. There are temples on the high hills on the acropolis, while houses are scattered around the center of the city and other suitable parts of the site. Churches of the Christian period are to be found both inside and outside the city. Tombs are outside the city, especially on the W and S slopes of the acropolis. The finest and best-preserved rock tomb is to be found on the S. The W city gate is in ruins, and only sections of the W defense walls and towers are still standing. The second gate of the city is a gate with courtyard in a better state of preservation. Walking from here towards the E, one reaches first arcades and later a second theater. Kremna was built on a grid plan. The uneven surface of the acropolis is unsuitable for the application of such a plan, but instead of leveling the ground the main buildings were placed in the valleys, while the perpendicularly intersecting streets were led straight over the hills.
Very few of the buildings of the ancient city are still standing, most of them now consisting of mere heaps of stone and architectural fragments. The coins and sculpture found in Kremna are preserved in the Burdur Museum.

KOMAMA (Şerefönü) Turkey. City in Pisidia near Ürkütlü, 45 km S of Burdur, which first appears in the late Hellenistic period when it issued autonomous bronze coins. It belonged no doubt to the commune Milyadum mentioned by Cicero (Verr. 1.95), and may have been its capital. A colony was planted by Augustus about 6 B.C., entitled Colonia Julia Augusta Prima Fida Comama. As the site is on flat ground and completely unfortified, it seems to have been intended not so much to repress the unruly Pisidians as to serve as a market town spreading Roman influence by peaceful means; it was well situated near the junction of several important thoroughfares. The colonial coinage is of the 2d and 3d c. A.D. The surviving ruins are scanty. They lie on and around a hillock and consist merely of scattered blocks, some of which are inscribed and confirm the site. Nothing is standing. Many other cut blocks and inscriptions have been removed to neighboring villages.

Strab. 650), and probably they originally spoke a language which Strabo (631) calls Solymian and distinguishes from Pisidian; later this dialect died out, apart from personal names. The Solymi appear in Homer in the tale of Bellerophon (Il. 6.184).

Pamyphylia-Pisidia.

In 1892, a French research expedition, led by Victor Bérard, made a groundbreaking discovery in the ruined city. They found the inscription which allowed the identification of this place as ancient Ariassos. However, the city had to wait nearly a hundred years, until 1988, for a systematic examination. Then it became of interest to the participants of an international research programme - Pisidia Survey Project, aimed at creating documentation of ancient cities in Pisidia. Works in Ariassos were conducted under the leadership of Dr. Stephen Mitchell of Swansea University in the UK. His team created a plan for the entire settlement and identified the remains of the most important public buildings, including - a theater, a nymphaeum, baths, a bouleuterion, a prytaneion and several necropoles. Near Ariassos 25 ancient inscriptions and the remains of three roads from Roman times were also discovered. In the following years of the project the course of the ramparts at a distance of 500 meters was accurately traced. In the lower part of the city the remains of two basilicas from the early days of Christianity were identified. In 1990, during the works that were the continuation of the project, almost 500 meters of fortifications surrounding the city and two Christian basilicas in the lower part of Ariassos were discovered. The residential district, an aqueduct and a road that once connected Ariassos and Termessos, were studied. Through the efforts of the research team the general picture of the city's history and its importance in the history of the region were clarified. br>The ruins of the city stretch between the slopes of two mountains, from the monumental gate to the old road to Termessos, on the distance of 600 meters. This monumental gate, built in the 3rd century AD, is the best preserved building in the city.
Other structures are located on the slopes on both sides of the main road. These include a bouleuterion, a prytaneion and a small temple dating back to the Hellenistic period. However, most of the buildings identified in Ariassos are from the times of the Roman Empire. Among them it is worth noting an extensive nymphaeum and a complex of baths, as well as many houses, situated on a hillside. In the area of Ariassos there are three necropoles - to the east, south and north of the center. Especially the latter one noteworthy, because of the numerous sarcophagi representing the so-called Pisidian style. Some of them have been carved from stone blocks. Ariasoss ruins are not guarded and there is no entrance fee. (https://turkisharchaeonews.net/site/ariassos)",19996443,,0,"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [30.471113499999998, 37.1808705]}"

In the pronaos stand the bases of two columns, now lost. The walls of the cella are standing in some parts to 4m tall. The external face on the north wall is better preserved than on the south wall, and shows four square pillasters projecting from the wall, with carved mouldings at the base. The stylobate is also moulded, and rests on a crepidoma standing 1.3m above ground level. The pottery scatter around the temple included sherds of Middle Iron Age date, Hellenistic, Early Roman and Late Roman; as well as two glass rim sherds of likely Late Roman date. 

The temple stands in an upland agricultural basin to the south of the modern village. The basin is agricultural and terraced, and the temple itself is surrounded by shrubs, olive groves, and fruit trees. Soil on site (colour, type): yellowish brown with lots of small stones, pebbles.

Other archaeological remains can also be found in the basin. In the cliff edges around the edges of the basin are a number of rock-cut tombs, all now robbed, of uncertain date. There is also likely to have once been a Late Roman church somewhere in the basin, as a column capital was found in the courtyard of a nearby yayla, reused as an outdoor table.

The city is mentioned by Lucan (Phars. 8.259), and is listed in Ptolemy, Hierokles, and the Notitiae, but has no other history. (The conjectural emendation of Arsinoe to Syedra in Strabo 669 is to be rejected.) The coinage runs from Tiberius to Gallienus. The ruins are extensive but overgrown. The city wall, of large squared blocks, is well preserved, especially on the SE, but the other remains seem all to be later. On the E slope are the foundations of a temple, roughly constructed of reused stones and originally veneered. A tower on the summit, a large church, and numerous other walls and buildings may be seen among the overgrowth, and many inscriptions are built into them; over a dozen of these record agonistic victories.

Town in Pamphylia or Pisidia, 22 km N of Manavgat. Polybios (5.73.3) records that Etenna in 218 B.C. furnished 8000 troops to Garsyenis; he speaks of it as lying in the Pisidian mountain country above Side. It is not mentioned again before the Council of Ephesos in A.D. 341. There is, however, a handsome silver coinage of the 4th c. B.C., and the bronze coins extend from the 1st c. B.C. to the 3d c. A.D. The site at Sirt is determined by the preponderance of coins of Etenna found there, and confirmed by sherds of the Classical period—such sherds being very rare on the inland sites of this region. The previous location of Etenna at Gölcük, farther E beyond the river Melas, is thus disqualified.
The ruins occupy the slopes of a steep hill some 250 m high, N of the village. The ring wall, of irregular ashlar of good quality, is standing in part; the S slope, less steep than the others, is covered with overgrown remains of buildings for the most part unidentifiable. They include however a church, a rock-cut reservoir, and a roofed cistern; a spring of good water supplies the village below. On the N slope are numerous rock-cut tombs, said to number 52 in all. Two statues of women, about life-size, are lying on the hillside, and some half-dozen inscriptions of the Roman period have been seen. There is no theater, and no temple has been recognized.
